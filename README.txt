peng3d is an open-source 3D graphics engine written in python and with pyglet.

peng3d aims to make creating quick-and-easy visualizations and proof-of-concept projects easier
while still being powerful enough for larger projects as well.

peng3d is a set of tools and classes extending built-in pyglet and python functionality with easier to use variants that are still compatible with low-level programming and old code.

You can install peng3d by cloning this project and executing ``python setup.py install``.

See here for Linux::
   
   $ git clone https://github.com/not-na/peng3d.git
   
   $ cd peng3d
   
   $ python setup.py install

This package can also be installed via pip:
   
   $ pip install peng3d
