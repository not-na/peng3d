peng3d is an opensource 3d graphics engine written in python and with pyglet.

peng3d aims to make creating quick-and-easy visualizations and proof-of-concept projects easier.

peng3d is a set of tools and classes extending built-in pyglet and python functionality with easier to use variants that are still compatible with low-level programming and old code.

You can install peng3d by cloning this project and executing ``python setup.py install``.

See here for Linux::
   
   $ git clone https://github.com/not-na/peng3d.git
   
   $ cd peng3d
   
   $ python setup.py install

This package can also be installed via pip or easy_install::
   
   $ pip install peng3d
   
   or
   
   $ easy_install peng3d

More features coming soon!
